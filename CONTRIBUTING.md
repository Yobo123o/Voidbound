Thank you for your interest in helping build **Voidbound**! This project is in an early planning phase. Contributions are welcome as we flesh out the core mechanics and world.

## Roadmap

1. **Core Systems**
   - Flesh out `Player`, `Enemy`, and `Zone` classes.
   - Create simple combat interactions and health management.
2. **World Generation**
   - Implement zone connections and basic exploration logic.
   - Populate zones with randomized events and enemies.
3. **Narrative & Lore**
   - Expand introductory text and NPC dialogue.
   - Add item descriptions and world-building notes.
4. **User Interface**
   - Start with a simple text interface.
   - Plan for potential graphical front end in the future.

Pull requests that tackle any of these milestones are greatly appreciated. Feel free to open issues with ideas or suggestions.
