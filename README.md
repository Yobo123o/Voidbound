# Voidbound

**Voidbound** is an experimental dark fantasy roguelike written in Python. The repository currently contains a minimal code skeleton and is under heavy development. Running `python -m voidbound` prints a development message, but a small text-based demo can be launched with `python -m voidbound.main`.

## 🌌 The Curse of the Voidbound

> *You awaken in darkness. Again.*
> The stone beneath you is cold and wet. You've lost count of how many times you've clawed your way out of the black.
> The world above has crumbled and the dead walk not by magic but by memory.
> You are Voidbound, branded by the Sigil of Return. Each death rewinds the world, yet something always stays.
> Escape is a lie. Understanding may not be.
