# Voidbound

**Voidbound** is a dark fantasy, text-based roguelike RPG written in Python.
This repository is in the very early stages of development. Core mechanics are still being prototyped and the codebase is likely to change rapidly.
You are a soul cursed to die and return, trapped in a decaying world where memory fades, but pain persists. Each cycle brings you deeper into the truth — and closer to the void.

## 🌌 The Curse of the Voidbound

> *You awaken in darkness. Again.*  
> The stone beneath you is cold. Wet. You’ve lost count of how many times you've clawed your way out of the black.  
>  
> The world above has crumbled. The sky is cracked. The dead walk not by magic, but by memory.  
>  
> You are Voidbound — branded by the Sigil of Return, tethered to the last ember of a dying flame.  
> Each death rewinds the world. But something always stays.  
>  
> Escape is a lie. But understanding may not be.
