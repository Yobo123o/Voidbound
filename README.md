# Voidbound

**Voidbound** is a dark fantasy, text-based roguelike RPG written in Python.  
You are a soul cursed to die and return, trapped in a decaying world where memory fades, but pain persists. Each cycle brings you deeper into the truth — and closer to the void.

## 🌌 The Curse of the Voidbound

> *You awaken in darkness. Again.*  
> The stone beneath you is cold. Wet. You’ve lost count of how many times you've clawed your way out of the black.  
>  
> The world above has crumbled. The sky is cracked. The dead walk not by magic, but by memory.  
>  
> You are Voidbound — branded by the Sigil of Return, tethered to the last ember of a dying flame.  
> Each death rewinds the world. But something always stays.  
>  
> Escape is a lie. But understanding may not be.
